Developed audio recognition services in Golang, creating a Shazam-like solution for identifying music in user-generated content. Extended to transcoding video content, extracting audio for sound analysis, and integrating with Shazam service API. Utilized MySQL as the database engine, Golang for API services, and Apache Kafka as a message broker.
